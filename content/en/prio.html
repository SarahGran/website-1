        <h2>What is Prio?</h2>

        <p><a href=https://crypto.stanford.edu/prio/>Prio</a> is a privacy-respecting system for the collection of aggregate statistics such as application metrics.</p>

        <p>Applications such as web browsers, mobile applications, or websites generate data. Normally they would just send all of the data back to the application developer, but Prio applications split the data into two anonymized and encrypted shares and upload each share to different data share processors that do not share data with each other. This way only minimal information about the original data is revealed to either processor. Each processor then aggregates its data shares into a partial sum. The partial sums can then be combined into a final aggregation, permitting useful statistics over the whole body of data while revealing minimal information about individual participants.</p>

        <p>To learn more about the foundations of Prio, consult <a href=https://crypto.stanford.edu/prio/paper.pdf>the Prio research paper by Henry Corrigan-Gibbs and Dan Boneh of Stanford University</a>.</p>

        <h2>ISRG Prio Services</h2>
        <p>ISRG can operate Prio data share processors for your organization. The software we use is <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-server">open source</a> and we have extensive experience running public benefit infrastructure. Our team also operates the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate authority.</p>
            
        <p>Because the privacy-respecting architecture of Prio depends on splitting user metrics up into two shares, you will need a second Prio data share processor server. The second data share processor can be operated by your organization or another provider.</p>
