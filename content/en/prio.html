        <h2>What is Prio?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><a href=https://crypto.stanford.edu/prio/>Prio</a> is a privacy-respecting system for the collection of aggregate statistics such as application metrics.</p>

        <p>In Prio, applications such as a web browser, mobile application or a website generate data, split it into two anonymized and encrypted shares shares, and upload each share to a different data share processor, such that neither processor can learn much about the original data. Each processor then aggregates its data shares into a partial sum, which can be combined into the final aggregation, permitting useful statistics over the whole body of data to be computed while revealing barely any information about individual participants, so long as either one of the data share processors does not disclose their data shares.</p>

        <p>To learn more about the foundations of Prio, consult <a href=https://crypto.stanford.edu/prio/paper.pdf>the Prio research paper by Henry Corrigan-Gibbs and Dan Boneh of Stanford University</a>.</p>

        <h2>ISRG Prio Services</h2>
        <p>ISRG can operate Prio data share processors for your organization. The software we use is <a href="https://github.com/abetterinternet/prio-server">open source</a> and we have extensive experience running public benefit infrastructure. Our team also operates the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate authority.</p>
            
        <p>Because the privacy-respecting architecture of Prio depends on splitting user metrics up into two shares, you will need a second Prio data share processor server. The second data share processor can be operated by your organization or another provider.</p>
